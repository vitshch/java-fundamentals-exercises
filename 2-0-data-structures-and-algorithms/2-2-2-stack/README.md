Learn the Stack data structure and gain deep understanding implementing it on your own 💪


### WHY ❓
[Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is one of the most important data structures 
for software developers. It can be used in various algorithms, but the most important is that **JVM creates a stack 
for each thread.** 😯 Even if you don't know anything about concurrency, and you write a simple application, it is still
**executed by one main thread.** So each thread has its own stack, and **that stack is used to store method frames.** 😲
A [method frame](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se16/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6) is just a term. It simply
means all the information we operate with, when executing a method. E.g. **when you pass some arguments, or create 
local variable, all that data is stored to the stack.** So, **every a method is called, a new stack frame is created and
stored to the stack.** 

> It is important to understand Stack, because otherwise you won't be able to understand fundamental things like **how JVM executes methods** and **how it uses memory**.

### Objectives
* implement a generic class `Node<T>` ✅
* **push an element onto the stack** ✅
* **get an element from the stack** ✅
* maintain stack **size** ✅
