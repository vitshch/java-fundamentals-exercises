Improve your TDD skills implementing LinkedList

### Task
`List` is an API that represents a well-known data structure. Your job is to 
implement the *todo* section of the class `LinkedList` **following TDD rules**. Please note, that your implementation 
should be based on **singly liked  nodes.** It means that you should create your own class `Node<T>` 
that will hold list elements. 
  
To verify your implementation check if your `LinkedListTest.java` provides full **(100%) code coverage** and compare it 
with **completed exercise**
 
### Pre-conditions‚ùó
You're supposed to know [The Three laws of TDD](https://github.com/bobocode-projects/java-fundamentals-exercises/tree/main/6-0-test-driven-development#the-three-laws-of-tdd),
 be familiar with Linked List data structure, and be able to write Java code

### How to start‚ùì
* Just clone the repository and create a branch **exercise/your_username** if you want your code to be reviewed
* Start implementing the **todo** section and verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
