Improve your TDD skill implementing Stack

### Task
**Stack** is last in, first out (LIFO) collection of elements. Your job is to implement the interface `Stack`
 using TDD discipline
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to know [The Three laws of TDD](https://github.com/bobocode-projects/java-fundamentals-exercises#the-three-laws-of-tdd) relink,
  be familiar with Stack data structure, and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing `Stack` interface following *three laws of TDD*
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the [exercise/completed](https://github.com/bobocode-projects/java-fundamentals-exercises/tree/exercise/completed) branch and see the final implementation
