Improve your TDD skill implementing Binary Search Tree

### Task
**Binary Search Tree (BST)** is an ordered (sorted) data structure. Your job is to implement the interface `BinarySearchTree`
 by practicing TDD discipline
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to know [The Three laws of TDD](https://github.com/bobocode-projects/java-fundamentals-exercises/tree/main/6-0-test-driven-development#the-three-laws-of-tdd),
be familiar with [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) data structure, 
and understand [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing `BinarySearchTree` interface following *three laws of TDD*
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout branch **completed** and see the final implementation
