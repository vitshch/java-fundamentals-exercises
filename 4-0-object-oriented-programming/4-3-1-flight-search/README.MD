Improve your OOP skills and learn the power on polymorphism by inverting the compile-time dependency 💪

### Task
`FlighService` and package `service` represent a component of the system that holds a business logic. `FlightDao` 
and package `data` represent a component of the system that implements data access layer. Your job is to implement 
the *todo* section of those classes **following OOP design principles.**
 
### Pre-conditions ❗️
You're supposed to be familiar polymorphism and Java interfaces

### Objectives
* **implement `FlightDao`** (data access object) methods using a simple `HashMap` ✅
* **implement service method** that allows to **register flight** using DAO ✅
* **implement service method** that allows **search for a flight** using DAO ✅
* **invert the dependency** between service and DAO by adding an interface ✅
