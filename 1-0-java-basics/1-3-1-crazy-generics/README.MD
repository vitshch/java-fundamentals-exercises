#### Learn tricky nuances and become the master of type parametrization in Java 💪

### WHY ❓
Generics in Java provide **safe type parametrization.** Sou can write the logic of a method or a whole class and 
**reuse it for different types**. Before Java 5 (when generics were introduced), common logic could be reused as well. 
However, it required **using `Object` everywhere and casting it everytime you want to get an actual type**.
It **could easily cause `ClassCastException` at runtime which is not safe.**  When using generics, it's still the same `Object`,
but **now compiler creates casts for you implicitly, and makes sure you didn't mess up with types**, which **moves errors from
runtime to compile time and makes type parametrization safer.**

### Objectives
* create a generic class with **simple type parameter** ✅
* create a generic class with **bounded type parameter** ✅
* create a generic class with **multiples type parameter** ✅
* create a generic class with **recursively bounded type parameter** ✅
* create a **generic method** ✅
* create a method that accepts a generic class on any type using **wildcard** ✅
* create method parameter using **bounded wildcard** ✅
