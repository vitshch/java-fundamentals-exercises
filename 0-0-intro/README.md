Learn how to use this course to build strong skill needed for enterprise Java development 

## The only way to learn effectively is to **learn by doing!** 💪

Therefore, this whole repository consists of **various exercises grouped by topics**. By doing exercises you will **build strong skills and neven get stuck.** Introduction itself is an exercise, so you can understand the idea on the simplest example.

Each exercise has three major parts:
* **a task** – some logic that you implement in order build a certain skill 👨🏻‍💻
* **a test** – a corresponding test that verifies if you implement the task correctly ▶️
* **a completed solution** - a branch `completed` that holds implemented task ✅

Go ahead and do this exercise by implementing a method in `Introduction` class. 💪 
_(we know it's silly, but we wanted to give you a simple example 😀)_
